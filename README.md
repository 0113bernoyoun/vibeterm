## Why VibeTerm?

You're in the zone. Ideas are flowing. The last thing you need is to break your momentum switching between apps, windows, and contexts.

**VibeTerm is built for vibe coders** — developers who use AI CLI tools like Claude Code and Codex, and want IDE-level productivity without leaving the terminal.

- **Split, don't switch.** Open multiple terminals side by side. No more ⌘+Tab hell.
- **Files at your fingertips.** Browse and open files without leaving the terminal.
- **Your workspace, your way.** Tabs, panes, themes — organize how you think.
- **Native & fast.** Built with Rust. Feels like part of macOS.

## Context Management (v0.7.0)

VibeTerm now includes intelligent context awareness to support AI-assisted development workflows.

### Git Status Integration

Real-time git status indicators in the sidebar help you understand repository state at a glance:

- **Status Indicators**: M (Modified), A (Staged), U (Untracked), D (Deleted), R (Renamed), ! (Conflicted)
- **Repository Status**: Branch name, commits ahead/behind remote
- **Automatic Caching**: Git cache refreshes every 5 seconds for performance
- **File-Level Tracking**: Each file in sidebar shows its current git status

### File Pinning

Pin important files for AI context using the sidebar interaction. Pinned files are prioritized for AI-assisted workflows:

- **Manual Pinning**: Click the pin icon or use context menu to pin files
- **Pin Indicator**: Pinned files show a 📌 indicator in the sidebar
- **Smart Eviction**: LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction when limit is reached
- **Max Capacity**: Up to 50 pinned files per workspace

### File System Watching

VibeTerm automatically monitors your project directory for changes:

- **Automatic Refresh**: Sidebar refreshes instantly when files are created, modified, or deleted
- **Smart Debouncing**: 200ms debounce prevents excessive updates during rapid changes
- **Build Artifact Filtering**: Automatically ignores `.git`, `target/`, `node_modules/`, and other build directories
- **Performance**: Minimal CPU/memory overhead with efficient event batching

## Sidebar Features

The sidebar provides contextual file browsing tied to your focused pane.

### Smart Project Detection

VibeTerm automatically detects project roots by looking for:
- `.git` (Git repositories)
- `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
- `package.json` (Node.js projects)
- `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript projects)
- `pyproject.toml` (Python projects)
- And more...

### Pane Indicators

- The sidebar header displays mini-tabs for each pane
- Click a mini-tab to instantly focus that pane
- The sidebar automatically switches to show the focused pane's directory
- Supports non-blocking async loading (up to 1000 files, 10 directory levels)

### Navigation

- Click to open/focus files in the terminal
- Files are loaded asynchronously for smooth interaction
